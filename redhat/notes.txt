[user@host ~]$  			[root@host ~]#

The command is the name of the program to run. It might be followed by one or more options, which adjust the behavior of the command or what it does. Options normally start with one or two dashes (-a or --all, for example) to distinguish them from arguments. Commands might also be followed by one or more arguments, which often indicate a target that the command should operate on
For example, in the usermod -L user01 string, usermod is the command, -L is the option, and user01 is the argument

ssh
An alternative way to authenticate to a remote machine without entering a password is through public key authentication

The ssh command -i option is used to specify the user's private key file, which is mylab.pem. The matching public key is already set up as an authorized key in the remoteuser account.

[user@host ~]$ ssh -i mylab.pem remoteuser@remotehost  you can use the chmod 600 mylab.pem command to ensure that only the owner can read the file

/dev	Special device files that the system uses to access hardware.
/etc	System-specific configuration files.
/home	Home directory, where regular users store their data and configuration files.
/root	Home directory for the administrative superuser, root.
/run	Runtime data for processes that started since the last boot. This data includes process ID files and lock files. The contents of this directory are re-created on reboot. This directory consolidates the /var/run and /var/lock directories from earlier versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
/tmp	A world-writable space for temporary files. Files that are not accessed, changed, or modified for 10 days are deleted from this directory automatically. The /var/tmp directory is also a temporary directory, in which files that are not accessed, changed, or modified in more than 30 days are deleted automatically.
/usr	Installed software, shared libraries, including files, and read-only program data. Significant subdirectories in the /usr directory include the following commands:
/usr/bin: User commands

/usr/sbin: System administration commands

/usr/local: Locally customized software

/var	System-specific variable data should persist between boots. Files that dynamically change, such as databases, cache directories, log files, printer-spooled documents, and website content, might be found under /var.

The touch command updates the time stamp of a file to the current date and time without otherwise modifying it.

You can create two types of links: a hard link, or a symbolic link (sometimes called a soft link).The new hard link acts exactly like the original file name. After the link is created, you cannot tell the difference between the new hard link and the original name of the file.You can determine whether a file has multiple hard links by using the ls -l command.You can use the "ln" command to create a hard link (another file name) that points to an existing file. The command needs at least two arguments: a path to the existing file, and the path to the hard link that you want to create.--- ln newfile.txt /tmp/newfile-hlink2.txt    To determine whether two files are hard linked, use the ls command -i option to list each file's inode number. If the files are on the same file system and their inode numbers are the same, then the files are hard links that point to the same data file content.Even if the original file is deleted, you can still access the contents of the file provided that at least one other hard link exists.Second, you can use hard links only if both files are on the same file system.

Create Symbolic Links
The ln command -s option creates a symbolic link, which is also called a "soft link". A symbolic link is not a regular file, but a special type of file that points to an existing file or directory. symbolic links can link two files on different file systems. Symbolic links can point to a directory or special file, not just to a regular file.



Pattern	Matches
*	Any string of zero or more characters
?	Any single character
[abc…​]	Any one character in the enclosed class (between the square brackets)
[!abc…​]	Any one character not in the enclosed class
[^abc…​]	Any one character not in the enclosed class
[[:alpha:]]	Any alphabetic character
[[:lower:]]	Any lowercase character
[[:upper:]]	Any uppercase character
[[:alnum:]]	Any alphabetic character or digit
[[:punct:]]	Any printable character that is not a space or alphanumeric
[[:digit:]]	Any single digit from 0 to 9
[[:space:]]	Any single white space character, which might include tabs, newlines, carriage returns, form feeds, or spaces


When the original regular file is deleted, the symbolic link still points to the file but the target is gone

[user@host glob]$ echo {Sunday,Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday}.log
Sunday.log Monday.log Tuesday.log Wednesday.log
[user@host glob]$ echo file{1..3}.txt
file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
[user@host glob]$ echo file{a..c}.txt
filea.txt fileb.txt filec.txt
[user@host glob]$ echo file{a,b}{1,2}.txt
filea1.txt filea2.txt fileb1.txt fileb2.txt
[user@host glob]$ echo file{a{1,2},b,c}.txt
filea1.txt filea2.txt fileb.txt filec.txt


variables
[user@host ~]$ USERNAME=operator
[user@host ~]$ echo $USERNAME
operator
To prevent mistakes due to other shell expansions, you can put the name of the variable in curly braces, for example ${VARIABLENAME}.

[user@host ~]$ USERNAME=operator
[user@host ~]$ echo ${USERNAME}
operator
Variable names can contain only letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and underscores. Variable names are case-sensitive and cannot start with a number.

echo my directory is $(pwd)
my directory is /root/yusuf/redhat


The backslash (\) is an escape character in the Bash shell. It protects the following character from expansion.

[!b]*  b olmayan demek

*[[:digit:]]*    matches only file names that contain a number?


Use the man command -k option (equivalent to the apropos command) to search for a keyword in man page titles and descriptions

The man command -K (uppercase) option searches for the keyword in the full-text page, not only in the titles and descriptions. A full-text search uses greater system resources and takes more time. The /usr/share/man directory contains all man pages



stdin 0
stdout 1
stderr 2
 If you redirect stdout to a file and the file does not exist, then the file is created.
2> /dev/null     displays output to a terminal and discards all error messages

VIM
A v keystroke enters visual mode, where multiple characters might be selected for text manipulation. Use Shift+V for multiline and Ctrl+V for block selection. To exit the visual mode, use the v, Shift+V, or Ctrl+V keystrokesIf you are unsure which mode Vim is using, then press Esc a few times to get back into command mode.

The u key undoes the most recent edit.

The x key deletes a single character.
hang back, jump down, kick up, leap forward.

Change the Shell Environment
You can use the set command to list all shell variables that are currently set.
For example, the HISTFILE, HISTFILESIZE, and HISTTIMEFORMAT shell variables affect the shell history and the history command
If a shell variable is not an environment variable, then only the shell can use it. However, if a shell variable is an environment variable, then the shell and any programs that run from that shell can use the variable.

You can assign any variable that is defined in the shell as an environment variable by marking it for export with the export command.
[user@host ~]$ EDITOR=vim
[user@host ~]$ export EDITOR
veya
[user@host ~]$ export EDITOR=vim  boyle tek satirda da olur

Another important environment variable is PATH. The PATH variable contains a list of colon-separated directories that contain programs:
[user@host ~]$ echo $PATH
/home/user/.local/bin:/home/user/bin:/usr/share/Modules/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin

When you run a command such as the ls command, the shell looks for the ls executable file in each of those directories in order, and runs the first matching file that it finds. (On a typical system, this file is /usr/bin/ls.)


Set Variables Automatically
When Bash starts, several text files run with shell commands that initialize the shell environment. To set shell or environment variables automatically when your shell starts, you can edit these Bash startup scripts.



For interactive login shells, the /etc/profile and ~/.bash_profile files configure the Bash environment. The /etc/profile and ~/.bash_profile files also source the /etc/bashrc and ~/.bashrc files respectively. For interactive non-login shells, only the /etc/bashrc and ~/.bashrc files configure the Bash environment. Whereas the /etc/profile and /etc/bashrc files apply to the whole system, the ~/.bash_profile and ~/.bashrc files are user-specific. Non-interactive shells invoke any files that the BASH_ENV variable defines. This variable is not defined by default.

To create a variable that is available to all of your interactive shells, edit the ~/.bashrc file. To apply a variable only once after the user logs in, define it in the ~/.bash_profile file.

[user@host ~]$ alias hello='echo "Hello, this is a long string."'
[user@host ~]$ hello
Hello, this is a long string.

[user@host ~]$ echo $file1
/tmp/tmp.z9pXW0HqcC
[user@host ~]$ unset file1
[user@host ~]$ echo $file1


To unexport a variable without unsetting it, use the export -n command:
[user@host ~]$ export -n PS1
To unset an alias, use the unalias command:
[user@host ~]$ unalias hello

 USER GROPUS
The superuser account administers the system. The superuser name is root and the account has a UID of 0. The superuser has full system access.
The system user accounts are used by processes that provide supporting services. These processes, or daemons, usually do not need to run as the superuser. They are assigned non-privileged accounts to secure their files and other resources from each other and from regular users on the system. Users do not interactively log in with a system user account.
Most users have regular user accounts for their day-to-day work. Like system users, regular users have limited access to the system.

Use the id command to show information about the currently logged-in user:
ip user buda o kullanici hakkinda bilgi verir

The /etc/sudoers file is the main configuration file for the sudo command

UID 0 : The superuser (root) account UID.

UID 1-200 : System account UIDs that are statically assigned to system processes.

UID 201-999 : UIDs that are assigned to system processes that do not own files on this system. Software that requires an unprivileged UID is dynamically assigned a UID from this available pool.

UID 1000+ : The UID range to assign to regular, unprivileged users.

usermod -c "Operator Two" operator2    Sonuç olarak, bu komut, operator2 adlı kullanıcının tam adını "Operator Two" olarak değiştirir. Kullanıcının tam adı genellikle sadece bilgilendirme amacıyla kullanılır ve sistemdeki birçok yerde görülebilir.



The groupadd command -g option specifies a GID for the group to use.
[root@host ~]# groupadd -g 10000 group01
The groupmod command changes the properties of an existing group. The groupmod command -n option specifies a new name for the group.
[root@host ~]# groupmod -n group0022 group02


Notice that the group name updates to group0022 from group02. The groupmod command -g option specifies a new GID.
[root@host ~]# groupmod -g 20000 group0022

[root@host ~]# groupdel group0022

A user's primary group is the group that is viewed on the user's account in the /etc/passwd file


Create the operators supplementary group with a GID of 30000.
[root@servera ~]# groupadd -g 30000 operators


Create the admin supplementary group without specifying a GID.
[root@servera ~]# groupadd admin

Add the operator1, operator2, and operator3 users to the operators group.
[root@servera ~]# usermod -aG operators operator1
[root@servera ~]# usermod -aG operators operator2
[root@servera ~]# usermod -aG operators operator3

Create the /etc/sudoers.d/admin file so that the members of the admin group have full administrative privileges.
[root@servera ~]# echo "%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL" >> /etc/sudoers.d/admin


Create the consultants group with a GID of 35000.
[root@serverb ~]# groupadd -g 35000 consultants

Create the consultant1, consultant2, and consultant3 users with the consultants group as their supplementary group.
[root@serverb ~]# useradd -G consultants consultant1
[root@serverb ~]# useradd -G consultants consultant2
[root@serverb ~]# useradd -G consultants consultant3

Set the account expiry date of the consultant1, consultant2, and consultant3 accounts to the same value as determined in the preceding step. For example:
[root@serverb ~]# chage -E 2022-06-08 consultant1

Change the password policy for the consultant2 account to require a new password every 15 days.
[root@serverb ~]# chage -M 15 consultant2


Chapter 7. Control Access to Files

Permission	Effect on files	Effect on directories
r (read)	File contents can be read.	        Contents of the directory (the file names) can be listed.
w (write)	File contents can be changed.	        Any file in the directory can be created or deleted.
x (execute)	Files can be executed as commands.	The directory can become the current working directory. You can run the cd command to it, but it also requires read permission to list files there.

Anyone who owns or has write permissions to a directory can remove files on it, regardless of the ownership or permissions on the file itself. You can override this behavior by using the sticky bit permission, to be discussed later in this chapter.

Use the ls command -d option to show detailed information about a directory itself, and not its contents.
[user@host ~]$ ls -ld /home
drwxr-xr-x. 5 root root 4096 Feb 31 22:00 /home

The first character of the long listing is the file type, and is interpreted as follows:

- is a regular file.
d is a directory.
l is a symbolic link.
c is a character device file.
b is a block device file.
p is a named pipe file.
s is a local socket file.

r	read	Read access to the file. Listing access to the directory.
w	write	Write permissions to the file or directory.
x	execute	Execute permissions to the file. Allows entering the directory, and accessing files and subdirectories inside the directory.
X	special execute	Execute permissions to a directory, or execute permissions to a file if at least one of the execute bits is set.

[user@host ~]$ chmod go-rw document.pdf

Add execute permission for everyone on the myscript.sh file:
[user@host ~]$ chmod a+x myscript.sh

[root@host opt]# chmod -R g+rwX demodir
sets read and write access on the demodir directory and all its children for their group owner, but applies group execute permissions only to directories and files where execute permission is already set for user, group, or other.

To add read permissions for this access level, add 4.
To add write permissions, add 2.
To add execute permissions, add 1.
[user@host ~]$ chmod 644 sample.txt

to grant ownership of the app.conf file to the student user,
[root@host ~]# chown student app.conf

For example, the following command changes the group ownership of the Pictures directory to admins:
[root@host ~]# chown :admins Pictures

to change the ownership of the Pictures directory to the visitor user and the group to guests, use the following command:
[root@host ~]# chown visitor:guests Pictures


Permission	Effect on files	Effect on directories
u+s (suid)	File executes as the user that owns the file, not as the user that ran the file.	No effect.
g+s (sgid)	File executes as the group that owns the file.	Files that are created in the directory have a group owner to match the group owner of the directory.
o+t (sticky)	No effect.	Users with write access to the directory can remove only files that they own; they cannot remove or force saves to files that other users own.

Add the setgid bit on the example directory by using the symbolic method:
[user@host ~]# chmod g+s example

Remove the setuid bit on the example directory by using the symbolic method:
[user@host ~]# chmod u-s example




Chapter 8. Monitor and Manage Linux Processes

ps aux   The common ps command aux option displays all processes including processes without a controlling terminal.
Listing Processes
The ps command is used for listing detailed information for current processes.

User identification (UID), which determines process privileges

Unique process identification (PID)

Amount of used CPU and elapsed real time

Amount of allocated memory

The process stdout location, which is known as the controlling terminal

The current process state

A signal is a software interrupt that is delivered to a process. Signals report events to an executing program. Events that generate a signal can be an error, an external event (an I/O request or an expired timer), or by the explicit use of a signal-sending command or keyboard sequence.

You can use the kill command -l option to list the names and numbers of all available signals.
[user@host ~]$ kill -l
 1) SIGHUP      2) SIGINT      3) SIGQUIT     4) SIGILL      5) SIGTRAP
 6) SIGABRT     7) SIGBUS      8) SIGFPE      9) SIGKILL    10) SIGUSR1
11) SIGSEGV    12) SIGUSR2    13) SIGPIPE    14) SIGALRM    15) SIGTERM
16) SIGSTKFLT  17) SIGCHLD    18) SIGCONT    19) SIGSTOP    20) SIGTSTP
[user@host ~]$ kill -9 5199

[user@host ~]$ kill -SIGTERM 5205
