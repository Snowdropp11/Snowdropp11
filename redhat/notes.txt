[user@host ~]$  			[root@host ~]#

The command is the name of the program to run. It might be followed by one or more options, which adjust the behavior of the command or what it does. Options normally start with one or two dashes (-a or --all, for example) to distinguish them from arguments. Commands might also be followed by one or more arguments, which often indicate a target that the command should operate on
For example, in the usermod -L user01 string, usermod is the command, -L is the option, and user01 is the argument

ssh
An alternative way to authenticate to a remote machine without entering a password is through public key authentication

The ssh command -i option is used to specify the user's private key file, which is mylab.pem. The matching public key is already set up as an authorized key in the remoteuser account.

[user@host ~]$ ssh -i mylab.pem remoteuser@remotehost  you can use the chmod 600 mylab.pem command to ensure that only the owner can read the file
